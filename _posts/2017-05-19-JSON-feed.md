When I learned about [JSON Feed][jsonfeed], I immediately liked the idea. It's like RSS/Atom, with the good parts (it's de-central) and without the bad parts (no more XML, well thought of standard attributes).

I'm not to sure how it will be used in practise, but it was easy enough to create a Jekyll template ([source on GitHub][feedtemplate]). I learned it's handy to add a `base`-tag to the `content_html`-attribute, after trying [this app][feedviewer]. 

And I made myself a [nice square logo][feedviewer_blog] too.
