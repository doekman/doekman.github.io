A while ago, [I created a shell script][gist] called `git-url`. It prints the remote origin URL of your current git-repository (or exit 1 if no git-repo is found). If the URL is in `git:` format, it is converted to `http:` format.

Why would one write this? Because of <code>open `git-url`</code>.

This will open the GitHub- or BitBucket-repository in your favorite browser. I use it all the time!

Above works on macOS. Windows uses `start` instead of `open`, but I don't know how it works with Windows Subsystem for Linux.
