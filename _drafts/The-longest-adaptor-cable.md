Introduction
============

At work I had to capture a video from an Video-8 camera to the computer, so some stills could be used for some report. The camera had Firewire (I mean [iLink][ilink]). Since I have a 2017 iMac, enter the world of adapters! However, you can't buy an USB-C to Firewire adapter. To big a step. But can we do it with baby steps? 

Thunderbolt 3 to iLink DV camera connector:

1) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C, male) to Thunderbold 2 (female, [apple](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/MMEL2ZM/A/adapter-voor-thunderbolt-3-usb%E2%80%91c-naar-thunderbolt-2))
2) Thunderbolt (male) to Firewire 800 (9p female, [apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD464LL/A/apple-thunderbolt-to-firewire-adapter))
3) Firewire 800 (9p male) to Firewire 400 (6p female)
4) Firewire 400 (6p male) to Firewire 400 (6p male)
5) Firewire 400 (6p female) to iLink/Firewire 400 mini (4p male)

But does it work. Yes, it does work (but I ended up capturing the composite output, because of iMovie).

But could it be simpler? Yes:

* Option 1: swap 4 & 5 with: Firewire 800 (9p male) to Firewire 400 (6p male) cable (I do have one of Belkin)
* Option 2: swap 4, 5 & 6 with: Firewire 800 (9p male) to iLink/Firewire 400 mini (4p male) cable

Is simpler necessary? 

* No

The challenge
=============

The challenge is to create the longest working adapter cable possible. There are however some rules.

1. An adapter type (from and to connector combination) should not used twice
2. Every adapter should be or should have been available commercially
   - unless the adapter is also an converter of electrical signals (such as an Covox). In such a case, it can be home made
3. All adapters should work through cables. No wireless connections allowed (opto-couplers for the sake of electrical isolation are excepted)
4. The 


The catagories
--------------

There maybe some overlap in categories with the universal connections nowadays. 

* Audio (digital and/or analog)
* Video (digital and/or analog)
* Peripherals and datatransfer (for connecting printers, keyboard, mice, hard drives, iP's)
