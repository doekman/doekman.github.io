title:  Office for OS X icons

**Updated**: _added Big Sur icons._

OS X, now called macOS, was based on the [NeXTSTEP][NeXTStep] operating system. And one innovation of this operating system was large full-color icons.

With the introduction of new icons this year with Office 365 (including the 2019 retail version), I felt the need to create this:

<html>
	<figure tabindex="0">
		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/office-for-os-x-icons.png %}" alt="Office for OS X icons (original)" class="non_hoover">
		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/office-for-os-x-icons-2023.png %}" alt="Office for OS X icons (2022 Pride update)" class="hoover">
		<figcaption>
			Office for OS X icons <span class="non_print comment">(focus or hover to display 2022 Pride update)</span>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</html>

In 2001, Office v. X was released. It's design was very distinct from Windows, and also very [aqua-y][aqua]. The maximum size was 256×256 pixels. The 2004 icons I found were oddly sized 128×128 pixels. The resolution of the 2008 and 2011 icons went up to 512×512 pixels. These were also the last OS X-specific icons for Office.

Starting with the 2016 version, the icons design of the Windows version was also used with macOS. And because of higher resolutions of displays, the dpi-count of the icons went up from 72dpi to 144dpi, making the 2016 and 2019 icons sized 1024×1024 pixels.

Haven't had enough? At the excellent Version Museum they have [all Windows icons of Word][Word] including screenshots. They also have a page on [Excel][] .
