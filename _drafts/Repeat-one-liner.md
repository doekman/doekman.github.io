I still love one-liners (back in the day, an one-liner was one line of BASIC code, doing something magic),
and today I like to continue [this tradition][one-liners]. 
To hell with [polyfills][]!

    function repeat(str,num) {
      return new Array(num+1).join(str);
    }

However, a while ago I came these [tweet sized d3][d3-1line] creations. Seems a much, much better idea to me.
So check it out...
